This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Tech Stack

The application is built with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. User authentication/log in is completed with Firebase. The component library used is material UI. 

Some Docs below:

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/ 

https://firebase.google.com/docs 

https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/ 

Connection to MongoDB can be established by navigating into the server folder and running: node server

# Goals / Issues

Currently working on getting the application connected to the server/MongoDB when it's deployed on Vercel. Having a hard time figuring out how to do it when it's not being ran locally. 

I also intend on cleaning up the code -- by a lot. Once final designs are made, I hope to create standardized/global style sheets and fix some of the things done in bad practice.
